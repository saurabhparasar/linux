    <h1>1. Linux is everywhere</h1>
    <p>
      Linux is everywhere; Linux jobs are everywhere. There is a demand for
      Linux skills in just about every industry and job category on the planet,
      and not enough Linux talent to meet this growing demand.<br />
      It’s also fun and rewarding to work with something that’s so much a part
      of our modern lives yet which so few people understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      If someone says they have Linux experience, it might refer to configuring
      system, running web servers, or any number of other services and programs
      that operate on top of Linux.<br />
      Over time, Linux administration has evolved to encompass just about every
      task that a modern business, educational institution or government
      organization might use in their daily operations.

      The journey of learning you are beginning today has no ending point. It
      can take you in a myriad of different direction,<br />
      from cybersecurity to application and game development, system
      administration, networking, big data, and artificial intelligence; all of
      these fields are rooted in Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time you execute a search on the internet, watch a videos on your
      phone or order something online, that’s likely Linux at work.<br />
      It epitomizes a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, a vast
      undertaking, done voluntarily, by some of the smartest people on the
      planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      While your journey will be ongoing, be comforted that you are learning a
      set of technologies, command, and methods that have stood <br />
      test of time. Linux utilizes and expands upon many of the commands and
      ways of accomplishing computing that UNIX began, with a rate of change per
      year that’s very manageable.<br />
      Now, some 30+ years on, many of those learned commands are still active
      and used every day by sysadmins, devops, and architects. Linux is a
      revolution of evolution, <br />
      you to learn the majority once and keep up with the small percentage of
      changes in a continual learning process.
